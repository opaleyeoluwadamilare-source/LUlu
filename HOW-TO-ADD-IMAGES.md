# How to Add Testimonial Images

## Quick Steps:

1. **Open the `public` folder** in your project:
   - Path: `C:\Users\OPAkg\Downloads\code (4)\public`

2. **Add these 3 image files** with these EXACT names:
   - `sarah.jpg` (or .jpeg/.png) - Sarah's photo
   - `marcus.jpg` (or .jpeg/.png) - Marcus's photo  
   - `jamie.jpg` (or .jpeg/.png) - Jamie's photo

3. **Save the images** you provided earlier with these names

4. **Restart the dev server** if it's running:
   - Stop it (Ctrl+C)
   - Run `npm run dev` again

## Image Matching:
- **sarah.jpg** → Sarah, 28, Marketing (woman with short dark curly hair)
- **marcus.jpg** → Marcus, 34, Former Corporate Drone (man with beard, in car)
- **jamie.jpg** → Jamie, 31, Overthinker in Recovery (woman with red hair and freckles)

## Troubleshooting:
- Open browser console (F12) to see which images are loading/failing
- Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
