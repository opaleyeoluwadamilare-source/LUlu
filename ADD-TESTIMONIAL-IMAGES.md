# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Add Testimonial Images

## The Problem:
The images are NOT in the `public` folder, which is why you're seeing placeholders.

## The Solution - 3 Simple Steps:

### Step 1: Locate Your Images
You provided 3 images earlier. Find them on your computer.

### Step 2: Copy Images to Public Folder
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\OPAkg\Downloads\code (4)\public`
3. Copy your 3 images into this folder

### Step 3: Rename the Images EXACTLY:
- Image 1 (Sarah - woman with short dark curly hair) → Rename to: `sarah.jpg`
- Image 2 (Marcus - man with beard, in car) → Rename to: `marcus.jpg`  
- Image 3 (Jamie - woman with red hair and freckles) → Rename to: `jamie.jpg`

## Supported File Formats:
- `.jpg` ✅ (preferred)
- `.jpeg` ✅
- `.png` ✅
- `.webp` ✅

## After Adding Images:
1. Save the files in the `public` folder
2. The dev server should auto-reload
3. Check browser console (F12) - you should see: `✅ Image loaded: /sarah.jpg`
4. Images will appear with beautiful effects!

## Current Status:
❌ `/sarah.jpg` - NOT FOUND
❌ `/marcus.jpg` - NOT FOUND  
❌ `/jamie.jpg` - NOT FOUND

Once you add them, they will work immediately!
